npx cypress open -> is the command to open the cypress.

this command should be run in termianl at cypress directory

it.only run only that test case in test suite

it.skip skip that specific test case in the test suite

Running the cypress from Command Line Interface:
    npx cypress run -> If you run this command it will run all the files under e2e folder and gives the report using inbuilt Mocha reporter.

    we didn't mention any spec files that's the reason it will run all files with extension .js
    After running Cypress will provide the screenshots for failure test cases and Videos recording.

    npx cypress run --spec "Cypress/e2e/login.cy.js"  --> Runs only specific file instead of running all files inside e2e.

    Everything will run by default as a "headless"  mode in background. If you wanna see the test run you need to specify as below.

    npx cypress run --spec "Cypress/e2e/login.cy.js" --headed

    npx cypress run --spec "Cypress/e2e/login.cy.js" --headed --no-exit  --> Not to close the browser instance after test execution.

    npx cypress run --spec "Cypress/e2e/login.cy.js" --headed --no-exit --browser chrome  --> to run in a specific browser.
